# Lab 1 (Due 2/4/2025)

## 1. Prelab
* Setup: To set up my laptop for Lab 1, I updated the ArduinoIDE, python, pip, and Ruby/Jekyll, installed the Sparkfun Apollo3 Boards Manager along with its BLE functionality in ArduinoBLE, downloaded the provided BLE codebase, configured a Python virtual environment for the class with the necessary Python packages, and started the necessary Jupyter server.
* Codebase: Add a brief explanation of your understanding of the codebase and how Bluetooth works between your computer and the Artemis

## 2. Lab Tasks
* Configurations: The most relevant configurations in Lab 1 were the updated MAC Address and UUID, which I have copied below.
      **MAC Address:** C0:81:48:26:03:64
      **UUID:** e2402ec7-6475-4e44-8a84-14f5f0a2714a
  ### Lab 1A: Running Examples
  1. Blink (Video)
 
  2. Serial (Image)
 
  3. Temperature Sensor (Video)
 
  4. Microphone Output (Video)

  ### Lab 1B: Ensuring Communication Ability w/RedBoard Artemis Nano
  

## 3. Discussion
* Briefly describe what you’ve learned, challenges that you faced, and/or any unique solutions used to fix problems. It is important to keep these writeups succinct. You will not get extra points for writing more words if the content doesn’t contribute to communicating your understanding of the lab material.
In this lab, I became familiar with using the sensors of the RedBoard Artemis Nano and receiving data using each of its sensors. The platform is not very intuitive, but with instruction, I seem to have properly configured the board without very many challenges.
