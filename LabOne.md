# Lab 1 (Due 2/4/2025)

## 1. Prelab
* Setup: To set up my laptop for Lab 1, I updated the ArduinoIDE, python, pip, and Ruby/Jekyll, installed the Sparkfun Apollo3 Boards Manager along with its BLE functionality in ArduinoBLE, downloaded the provided BLE codebase, configured a Python virtual environment for the class with the necessary Python packages, and started the necessary Jupyter server.
* Codebase: Add a brief explanation of your understanding of the codebase and how Bluetooth works between your computer and the Artemis

## 2. Lab Tasks
* Configurations: The most relevant configurations in Lab 1 were the updated MAC Address and UUID, which I have copied below.
      **MAC Address:** C0:81:48:26:03:64
      **UUID:** e2402ec7-6475-4e44-8a84-14f5f0a2714a

### Lab 1B: Ensuring Communication Ability w/RedBoard Artemis Nano
  

## 3. Discussion
* In this lab, I became familiar with using the sensors of the RedBoard Artemis Nano and receiving data using each of its sensors. The platform is not very intuitive, but with instruction, I seem to have properly configured the board without very many challenges.
