# Lab 4: Motor Drivers and Open-Loop Control (Due 3/4/2025)

## Prelab
* Diagram with your intended connections between the motor drivers, Artemis, and battery (with specific pin numbers)
* It is best to power the Artemis and the motor drivers/motors from separate batteries because...

## Lab Tasks
* Picture of your setup with power supply and oscilloscope hookup
* Power supply setting discussion
* Include the code snippet for your analogWrite code that tests the motor drivers
* Image of your oscilloscope
* Short video of wheels spinning as expected (including code snippet it’s running on)
* Short video of both wheels spinning (with battery driving the motor drivers)
* Picture of all the components secured in the car (Consider labeling your picture if you can’t see all the components)
* Explore the lower limit in PWM value for which the robot moves forward and on-axis turns while on the ground; note it may require slightly more power to start from rest compared to when it is running.
* Calibration demonstration (discussion, video, code, pictures as needed)
If your motors do not spin at the same rate, you will need to implement a calibration factor. To demonstrate that your robot can move in a fairly straight line, record a video of your robot following a straight line (e.g. a piece of tape) for at least 2m/6ft. (It may be helpful to note that each of the vinyl tiles in the lab is 1-by-1 foot. The robot should start centered on the line, and still partially overlap with the line at the end.)
* Open loop code and video
