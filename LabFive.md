# Lab 5: Linear PID control and Linear Interpolation (Due 3/11/2025)

## Prelab
* Clearly describe how you handle sending and receiving data over Bluetooth
* Consider adding code snippets as necessary to showcase how you implemented this on Arduino and Python

## Lab Tasks
* P/I/D discussion (Kp/Ki/Kd values chosen, why you chose a combination of controllers, etc.)
* Range/Sampling time discussion
* Graphs, code, videos, images, discussion of reaching task goal
* Graph data should include Tof vs time and Motor input vs time (and whatever helps with debugging)
