# Lab 6: Orientation Control (Due 3/18/2025)

## Prelab
* Clearly describe how you handle sending and receiving data over Bluetooth
* Consider adding code snippets as necessary to showcase how you implemented this on Arduino and Python

## Lab Tasks
* P/I/D discussion (Kp/Ki/Kd values chosen, why you chose a combination of controllers, etc.)
* Range/Sampling time discussion
* Graphs, code, videos, images, discussion of reaching task goal
* Graph data should at least include theta vs time (you can also consider angular velocity, motor input, etc)
