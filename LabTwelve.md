To demonstrate that youâ€™ve successfully completed the lab, please upload a brief lab report (<1.500 words), with code (not included in the word count), photos, and videos documenting that everything worked and what you did to make it happen. Include the most probable state after each iteration of the Bayes filter along with its probability, compare it with the ground truth pose, and write down your inference.
