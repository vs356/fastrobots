### Lab 1
1. Prelab
⋅⋅-Setup: Briefly describe the steps taken to set up your computer for Lab 1, showing any results (i.e. MAC address printing)
⋅⋅-Codebase: Add a brief explanation of your understanding of the codebase and how Bluetooth works between your computer and the Artemis
3. Lab Tasks
⋅⋅-Configurations: Show what the relevant configurations, anything that was specifically needed to address the tasks.
⋅⋅-Address all questions posed in the lab.
⋅⋅-Include a brief explanation on what you did and results for each task.
⋅⋅-Include screenshots, screen recordings, pictures, or videos of relevant results (i.e. messages received in Jupyter Notebook, serial terminal print of messages received by Artemis).
4. Discussion
⋅⋅-Briefly describe what you’ve learned, challenges that you faced, and/or any unique solutions used to fix problems. It is important to keep these writeups succinct. You will not get extra points for writing more words if the content doesn’t contribute to communicating your understanding of the lab material.
