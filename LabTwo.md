# Lab 2 (Due 2/11/2025)

## Lab Tasks:
### IMU
* The IMU is connected to the Artemis using the shortest QWIC connector as seen in the image below.
* Show that the IMU example code works
* According to the comments in the first example we review, AD0_VAL represents whether the ADR jumper is open (1) or closed (0).
* Acceleration and gyroscope data discussion (pictures recommended)

### Accelerometer
* Image of output at {-90, 0, 90} degrees for pitch and roll (include equations)
* Accelerometer accuracy discussion
* Noise in the frequency spectrum analysis, include graphs for your Fourier transform & discuss the results

### Gyroscope
* Include documentation for pitch, roll, and yaw with images of the results of different IMU positions
* Demonstrate the accuracy and range of the complementary filter, and discuss any design choices

### Sample Data
* Speed of sampling discussion
* Demonstrate collected and stored time-stamped IMU data in arrays
* Demonstrate 5s of IMU data sent over Bluetooth

To complete the lab, I familiarized myself with the car's basic motion profile by driving it using the remote. The car is very quick, so I struggled with making tight turns. The flips are easier to execute than expected, but the car is overall rather difficult to control.
