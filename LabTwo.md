# Lab 2 (Due 2/11/2025)

## Lab Tasks:
### IMU
* Picture of your Artemis IMU connections
* Show that the IMU example code works
* AD0_VAL definition discussion

* Accelerometer accuracy discussion
* Noise in the frequency spectrum analysis, include graphs for your Fourier transform & discuss the results

### Gyroscope
* Include documentation for pitch, roll, and yaw with images of the results of different IMU positions
* Demonstrate the accuracy and range of the complementary filter, and discuss any design choices

### Sample Data

To complete the lab, I familiarized myself with the car's basic motion profile by driving it using the remote. The car is very quick, so I struggled with making tight turns. The flips are easier to execute than expected, but the car is overall rather difficult to control.
